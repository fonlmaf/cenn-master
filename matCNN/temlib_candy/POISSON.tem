%Function:	Solves the Poisson PDE (Dx = -f(x)).

%TemLibName:	PoissonPDESolver

%CNNModel:	Single-layer, CT-CNN

%Given:		Static gray-scale images P1 and P2 = -f(x)

%Setting:	Input:Arbitrary(0), IniState:P1, Boundary:Zero-flux, BiasMap:P2

%Output:	Gray-scale image - the solution of the Poisson equation.

%Timing:	-
