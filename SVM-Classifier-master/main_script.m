Purpose: svm classification example.

Description: This module serves as script that initiates the SVM
classification algorithm.  The script already has a set of images on which 
to test the svm classifier.

Set the image_set_directory and image_set_complement_directory 
variables to the locations where your training data resides.  Keep in mind
that an svm can only make binary classifications. In other words, an 
svm can only make a desision on whether a image is a part of the training
set and its complement.

    various types of image processing statistics( see Create_Category_Data_Set
